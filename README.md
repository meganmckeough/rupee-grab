Play this [Legend of Zelda](https://www.zelda.com/) inspired mini game - an experiment in event listeners and learning Javascript. I dearly love but do not in any way own Legend of Zelda or similar products.

Can only be played in web browser with a keyboard. 
Manage your expectations - this is an early adventure in Javascript, not CSS. 

<3 Made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. <3
