# Rupee Grab!

## grab the rupee... 

#### A small game made with basic front-end skills, for fun and practice.

[Give it a try!](https://meganmckeough.github.io/rupee-grab/)

Play this [Legend of Zelda](https://www.zelda.com/) inspired mini game - an experiment in setInterval() and setTimeout(), and learning Javascript. I dearly love but do not in any way own Legend of Zelda or similar products.

Can only be played in web browser with a keyboard. 
Manage your expectations - this is an early adventure in Javascript, not CSS. 

<3 Made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. <3

#### Bugs

Still working to get the layout and responsiveness working for different screen sizes.
